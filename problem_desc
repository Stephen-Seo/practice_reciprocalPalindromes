Over on YouTube, Michael Penn proves that the sum of reciprocals of the
palindromes converges:

\sum_{p \in PALIN} 1/p

But he doesnâ€™t compute the value to which the sum converges.

Your task is to compute the infinite sum. When you are finished, you are welcome
to read a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the
exercise in the comments below.
